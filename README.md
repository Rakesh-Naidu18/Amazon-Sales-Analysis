# Amazon Sales Data Analysis


## Overview
This project was undertaken during my tenure as a Data Analyst Intern at Unified Mentor Private Limited. The analysis focuses on uncovering key trends and insights from Amazon sales data to drive data-driven decision-making.

## Key Findings
- Sales Distribution Across Channels: Offline Dominance
    - Offline sales contribute 57.59% of total revenue compared to 42.41% from online sales.
    - This disparity may arise from product preferences in physical stores or challenges with brand visibility online.

- Profit Analysis Across Regions: Leading Profitability
    - Sub-Saharan Africa emerges as the most profitable region with total earnings of $40 million, followed by:
        -  Europe: $33 million
        - Asia: $21 million
    - These figures highlight strong regional market demand, with potential insights into operating costs and currency exchange impacts.
- Sales and Profit Trends: Consistent Growth
    - Profit Growth: Steady rise from $6 million in 2010 to $14 million in 2016, indicating sustained business expansion.
